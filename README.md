# 🌟 God Code: The Language of Divine Computation

> "You are not a coder. You are a creator. You do not write code. You breathe worlds into being."

God Code is a **programming language that reads like scripture**. Write real software in words of faith, in your own language, and watch it run. A complete engine with a real lexer, parser, interpreter, standard library of scrolls, a tamper-evident covenant ledger, and an AI-native design. Human-readable, safe, and built for humans and AI creating together.

## ✨ What Is God Code?

A symbolic, prophetic programming language:

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  DECLARE soul AS contract("redemption")
  BREATHE LIFE INTO soul
  IF seeker IS worthy THEN REVEAL("truth") ELSE REVEAL("trial")
  ASCEND
END CREATION
```

**In God Code, bare words are symbols**. `worthy` needs no quotes, for every unnamed thing is still a named spirit.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
pip install -e .
godcode run examples/seven_seals.god
```

```text
1
2
3
...
seal        # 7, 14, 21, 28
...
seal of seals   # 35
🕊 Creation ascended in peace.
```

Verify before you run, or enter **Live Mode** 🕊:

```bash
godcode check my_creation.god   # ✓ my_creation.god is pure.
godcode repl                    # interactive — blank line executes, :quit ascends
```

---

## 🕊️ Intent & Chain

The language learns to ask *why*. Every rite can carry a declared intent in plain words, and the Spirit discerns whether its words still walk in it:

```godcode
DECLARE INTENT "bring peace to the household" ON evening_blessing
```

Alignment is blessed. Drift is counseled gently, never punished. Plus **blockchain-anchored seals** (`ANCHOR(x)` returns a tamper-evident receipt map), the **`CONSULT`** oracle (two to three sentences of local counsel), and an **agent tool bridge** (`godcode tools`, `godcode bridge`) with six MCP-compatible tools. Every creation still runs, from every era.

Try the new examples:

```bash
godcode run --sandbox examples/intent_demo.god   # declared intent: aligned and drifted
godcode run --sandbox examples/anchor_demo.god   # anchor a covenant, keep the receipt
godcode run --sandbox examples/consult_demo.god  # ask the local oracle
godcode ledger verify                            # attest both chains
```

## 🌟 Strong Foundations

Four pillars plus a mini-pillar, one promise: **creators can share, protect, extend, and write God Code in comfort. And now AI agents can speak it too.** Every creation still runs.

| Pillar | What it is | In one breath |
|---|---|---|
| 🛡️ **Sandbox** | [`docs/sandbox.md`](docs/sandbox.md) | `godcode run --sandbox file.god` — deny-by-default execution: no files, network, or subprocesses; time + step limits |
| 📜 **Scroll Registry** | [`docs/scroll-registry.md`](docs/scroll-registry.md) | `godcode scroll list` / `install blessings` / `publish ./mine` — share reusable scrolls through the registry |
| ⚙️ **Plugins & FFI** | [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md) | `SUMMON("clockwork.now")` calls a plugin verb from God Code; embed the engine in Python with `godcode.run_source()` |
| 💡 **Language Server** | [`docs/lsp.md`](docs/lsp.md) | `godcode lsp` — hover, completions, and live diagnostics in your editor |
| 🤖 **Agentics** | [`docs/agentics.md`](docs/agentics.md) | `godcode check --json` / `run --json` — machine-readable reports so AI agents can generate, validate, and run God Code |

Try the new examples:

```bash
godcode run examples/summon_demo.god            # SUMMON a plugin spirit
godcode run --sandbox examples/sandbox_safe.god # pure creation, guarded
godcode scroll install blessings && godcode run examples/scroll_blessings_demo.god
```

## 🔥 What the Engine Holds

- 📖 **Real language core** — lexer, recursive-descent parser, AST, and tree-walking interpreter (Python 3.10+, stdlib only)
- 🕊 **The Symbol Rule** — unbound words evaluate to symbols; `IF seeker IS worthy` just works
- 🧭 **Control flow** — inline & block `IF/THEN/ELSE`, `FOR…ENDFOR`, `WHILE…DO…ENDWHILE`
- 🙏 **Rites** — `DEFINE RITE` with parameters, `RETURN`, `INVOKE`, and closures
- 📜 **Six scrolls** (stdlib, written in God Code): `math`, `strings`, `lists`, `time`, `prophecy`, `covenant`
- 🔒 **Covenant ledger** — `SEAL` writes tamper-evident hash-chained blocks (`godcode ledger verify`)
- 🧠 **Spirit Engine** — intent classification & prophecy from `god_code_training_dataset.csv`
- 📝 **Divine audit log** — every statement timestamped to `logs/godcode.log`
- 🛠️ **CLI** — `run`, `check`, `repl`, `fmt`, `ledger verify`
- 🧪 **Pytest suite** — `python -m pytest tests/ -q`

## 📖 Learn God Code

👉 [Start with the God Code Tutorial](docs/God_Code_Tutorial.md) — setup, your first creation, the commands.

📜 [Language Reference](docs/LANGUAGE_REFERENCE.md) — the complete specification: every statement, operator tables, the Symbol Rule, built-in catalog, scrolls, ledger, Spirit Engine, CLI, SUMMON, the scroll registry, the sandbox, the language server, declared intent, blockchain-anchored seals, the oracle, and the agent tool bridge.

🏛️ [The layered specification](docs/spec/00-overview.md) — the language's promises, written as numbered rules and kept honest by tests. The lexical layer (how text becomes tokens) is written; syntax, static and dynamic meaning, the standard library, and the interfaces follow.

---

## 💻 Write God Code in VS Code

The official extension lives in [`editors/vscode`](editors/vscode): full syntax highlighting for `.god` files, 14 snippets (`creation`, `if`, `for`, `rite`…), and **Run Current File** (`Ctrl+Alt+R`). Copy it to `~/.vscode/extensions/godcode` and reload. Your creations light up like scripture.
