## 1. The Shape of a Program

Every God Code program is a **creation**. It opens with `BEGIN CREATION` and closes with `END CREATION`:

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  DECLARE seeker AS worthy
  IF seeker IS worthy THEN REVEAL("heaven") ELSE REVEAL("test")
  ASCEND
END CREATION
```

Statements live one per line (the inline `IF` form is the one exception. See §7).
`ASCEND` ends the creation early and in peace; reaching `END CREATION` ends it naturally.

To begin a whole project at once, run `godcode new my-scroll`: it raises a directory holding a starter scroll (`main.god`), a test scroll (`test_main.god`), a registry-ready `scroll.toml`, and a README. See the "Your first creation" lesson on the site learn page.

### Tongues: the grammar in other languages

A scroll may speak another tongue. Put a pragma comment in the file, e.g. `# tongue: tn` for Setswana, and the keywords cross over while everything else stays the same:

```godcode
# tongue: tn
QALA TLHOLEGO
BOLELA leina JAKA "Lefatshe"
SENOLA("Dumela, {leina}.")
FEDISA TLHOLEGO
```

English keywords keep working beside tongue words, `godcode fmt` renders the canonical English, and every tool (`run`, `check`, `lint`, `test`, the debugger, the bridge, the playground) honours the pragma. See `docs/TONGUES.md` for the full word table and the honest first-edition notes.

## 2. Words of the Language

- **Keywords are case-insensitive.** `begin creation`, `Begin Creation`, and `BEGIN CREATION` are all holy. Canonical style is UPPER.
- **Identifiers preserve case.** `seeker` and `Seeker` are different names.
- **Comments** begin with `#` and run to the end of the line.
- **Strings** use double quotes with escapes: `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\t`. An unterminated string is rejected with its line and column.
- **Numbers** are integers (`3`) or floats (`4.5`).

## 3. Values

| Value | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| number | `3`, `4.5` | int or float |
| string | `"peace"` | double-quoted, with escapes and `{expr}` interpolation |
| **symbol** | `worthy` | any bare word — see the Symbol Rule |
| boolean | `TRUE`, `FALSE` | literals; also produced by comparisons; revealed as `true`/`false` |
| list | `[1, two, "three"]` | ordered, mixed types allowed |
| contract | `contract("everlasting")` | created with the `contract()` rite |
| rite | *(from DEFINE RITE)* | a named, callable blessing |
| void | *(from rites with no RETURN)* | the absence of a value |

### The Symbol Rule 🕊

**In God Code, every unnamed thing is still a named spirit. Bare words are symbols.**

An identifier that is not bound to anything does not raise an error; it evaluates to a `Symbol` carrying its own name. This is what makes the founding idiom work:

```godcode
DECLARE seeker AS worthy     # `worthy` is a symbol — no quotes needed
IF seeker IS worthy THEN REVEAL("heaven")
```

Symbols are always truthy, and compare by their text: `worthy IS worthy` is true.

### How values are revealed

`REVEAL` renders values canonically:

| Value | Revealed as |
|---|---|
| number / string | as-is (`12`, `4.5`, `peace`) |
| symbol | its text (`worthy`) |
| boolean | `true` / `false` |
| list | `[1, two, three]` |
| contract | `contract("everlasting")` |
| void | `void` |

### Breathing values into strings

Wrap any expression in braces inside a double-quoted string and its revealed value is breathed into the words:

```godcode
DECLARE name AS "seeker"
REVEAL("grace upon {name}")            # grace upon seeker
REVEAL("{2 + 3} loaves")               # 5 loaves
REVEAL("shouted: {UPPER(name)}")       # shouted: SEEKER
```

The braces may hold any expression: names, arithmetic, comparisons, builtin rites like `UPPER` and `LEN`, even another interpolated string in escaped quotes (`"nested {\"inner {n}\"}"`). To write a plain brace, double it: `"{{"` and `"}}"` become `{` and `}`. A lone `}` stays as it is. An opening brace that is never closed is a gentle parse error, and it names the line.

### Truthiness

`FALSE`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `[]`, the empty map, and `void` are falsy. **Symbols are always truthy.** Everything else is truthy.

## 4. Names and Scope

- `DECLARE` **always defines in the current scope.** There is no rebinding of outer scopes. Declaring a name that exists outside creates (or updates) it in the current scope instead.
- A `WHILE` body runs in the **enclosing scope** (no new scope), so `DECLARE count AS count - 1` inside a `WHILE` loop updates the very name the loop's condition watches.
- A `FOR` body runs in **one child scope** that lasts for the whole loop, holding the loop variable. `DECLARE` inside a `FOR` body shadows the outer scope and does not touch it, so accumulation in `FOR` loops does not work the way it does in `WHILE` loops.
- An `IF`/`ELSE` body runs in the enclosing scope. There is no new scope.
- A rite call runs in a **child scope of the rite's definition site** (a closure): rites remember where they were born.
- `REFLECT` prints every name visible in the current scope (`name = value`, one per line).

## 5. The Statements

### `DECLARE name AS value`
Binds a name. Multiple comma-separated values become a list. The original idiom is honored:

```godcode
DECLARE seeker AS worthy
DECLARE pi AS 3.14159
DECLARE prophets AS Isaiah, Elijah, Jeremiah   # a list of three symbols
DECLARE pair AS [1, "two"]
```

### `BREATHE LIFE INTO name`
Breathes life into something bound — today, a contract. The name must already exist.

```godcode
DECLARE soul AS contract("redemption")
BREATHE LIFE INTO soul        # [BREATHE] Life breathed into soul 🕊
```

### `REVEAL(expr)`
Evaluates the expression and speaks it. Parentheses are required.

```godcode
REVEAL("peace")
REVEAL(2 + 2)                 # 4
REVEAL(soul)                  # contract("redemption")
```

### `PROPHESY words…`
Speaks free words to the Spirit Engine (§16), which answers with a prophecy. The words are the rest of the line, exactly as written. With no words, the Spirit prophesies over the whole creation.

```godcode
PROPHESY a harvest of wisdom approaches
PROPHESY
```

> ⚠️ Words that collide with keywords are read as keywords (`is` becomes `IS` in the prophecy text). Choose your words with care.

### `ASCEND`
Ends the creation immediately and in peace: `🕊 Creation ascended in peace.`

### `REFLECT`
Prints every name bound in the current scope, one `name = value` per line — a mirror for the soul of the program.

### `BLESS name` / `ANOINT name`
Marks a bound name as blessed / anointed and speaks a blessing. (Contracts carry `blessed` and `anointed` flags; sealing records them.)

### `SEAL expr`
Evaluates the expression and writes it into the **covenant ledger** (§15) — a tamper-evident chain of blocks. For a contract, its name, life, blessing, and anointing are recorded.

```godcode
SEAL covenant      # [SEAL] Covenant sealed · block 3 · a1b2c3d4 🔒
```

### `TESTIFY expr`
If the expression is truthy: `[TESTIFY] It is true. ✝`. If falsy, the testimony fails and the creation halts with an error.

### `TRY` … `CATCH` … `ENDTRY`
A sheltered work: the `TRY` block runs first, and if a **runtime error** rises anywhere inside it, execution jumps to the `CATCH` block. Errors rise up through rite calls, so a `TRY` also catches failures from rites invoked inside it. If no error rises, the `CATCH` block is skipped; afterwards the creation continues after `ENDTRY`.

```godcode
TRY
  REVEAL(fragile_work())
CATCH
  REVEAL("the work stumbled: {ERROR}")
ENDTRY
```

The error's plain message is bound for the `CATCH` to speak of. `CATCH` alone binds it to `ERROR`; `CATCH name` binds it to a name of your choosing:

```godcode
TRY
  DECLARE share AS harvest / workers
CATCH trouble
  REVEAL("no harvest today: {trouble}")
ENDTRY
```

What `TRY` catches, and what it does not:

- Only **runtime errors** (`GodRuntimeError`) are caught. Parse and lexer errors still fail before the creation runs.
- `RETURN` inside a `TRY` still returns from its rite, and `ASCEND` still ends the run in peace. Neither is ever caught.
- Sandbox boundaries are never caught: a `SandboxViolation` (a denied power under `--sandbox`) rises straight through any `TRY`.
- `TRY` blocks nest freely; the innermost `CATCH` handles the innermost error. An error raised inside a `CATCH` block rises outward normally.

## 6. Operators

### Arithmetic

| Op | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `+` | add numbers; **concatenate** strings/symbols; join lists |
| `-` `*` `/` `%` | numbers only (`/` yields float; `%` is for integers) |

```godcode
REVEAL("grace upon " + "seeker")   # grace upon seeker
REVEAL([1, 2] + [3])               # [1, 2, 3]
```

### Comparison

| Op | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `IS` | equality (also `==`) |
| `IS NOT` | inequality (also `!=`) |
| `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` | the usual comparisons |

Equality is generous: numbers compare across int/float, symbols compare by text, contracts by name, lists element-wise. Ordering comparisons (`<`, …) on mixed non-numeric values are rejected.

```godcode
IF seeker IS worthy THEN REVEAL("heaven")
IF count IS NOT 0 THEN REVEAL("not empty")
```

### Logic

`AND`, `OR` (short-circuiting), and `NOT` / unary `-`:

```godcode
IF heart IS pure AND hands IS willing THEN REVEAL("go")
REVEAL(NOT 0)          # true
```

### Precedence (low → high)

1. `OR`
2. `AND`
3. `NOT` (prefix)
4. `IS`, `IS NOT`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
5. `+`, `-`
6. `*`, `/`, `%`
7. unary `-`, `NOT`
8. calls, indexing, parentheses, literals

So `NOT a IS b` means `NOT (a IS b)`, and `2 + 3 * 4` is `14`.

## 7. Decisions: IF

**Inline** — one statement per branch, all on one line:

```godcode
IF seeker IS worthy THEN REVEAL("heaven") ELSE REVEAL("test")
IF n % 7 IS 0 THEN REVEAL("seal")        # ELSE may be omitted
```

**Block** — for many statements, closed with `ENDIF`:

```godcode
IF heart IS pure THEN
  REVEAL("the way is open")
  BLESS seeker
ELSE
  REVEAL("wait and be still")
ENDIF
```

`IF`s nest freely, and an `ELSE` always belongs to the nearest `IF`:

```godcode
IF n % 35 IS 0 THEN
  REVEAL("seal of seals")
ELSE
  IF n % 7 IS 0 THEN
    REVEAL("seal")
  ELSE
    REVEAL(n)
  ENDIF
ENDIF
```

## 8. Cycles: FOR and WHILE

**FOR** walks a list — or the characters of a string:

```godcode
DECLARE prophets AS Isaiah, Elijah, Jeremiah
FOR prophet IN prophets
  BREATHE LIFE INTO prophet
ENDFOR

FOR n IN RANGE(1, 6)
  REVEAL(n)
ENDFOR
```

The loop body runs in a child scope holding the loop variable. (`FOR` over anything else — a bare symbol, a number — is rejected.)

> 📜 *Legacy form:* the v1 prototype wrote `FOR` without `ENDFOR`, letting the body run to `END CREATION`. The grammar still accepts it, so `sample.godcode` keeps working. But new creations should always close with `ENDFOR`.

**WHILE** cycles while its condition holds, closed with `ENDWHILE`:

```godcode
DECLARE count AS 10
WHILE count > 0 DO
  REVEAL(count)
  DECLARE count AS count - 1
ENDWHILE
```

(Inline form: `WHILE count > 0 DO REVEAL(count)`.) A cycle that will not end is stopped after 100,000 iterations. *"The cycle is endless."*

**BREAK** releases the innermost loop at once; **CONTINUE** skips to its next turn:

```godcode
FOR n IN RANGE(1, 100)
  IF n IS 13 THEN
    BREAK            # the walk ends here; nothing more is revealed
  ENDIF
  IF n % 2 IS 0 THEN
    CONTINUE         # even numbers are passed over in silence
  ENDIF
  REVEAL(n)
ENDFOR
```

- In nested loops, `BREAK` releases only the innermost one. The outer cycle keeps turning.
- Both words work in `FOR` and `WHILE` alike, and in the inline form: `IF n IS 0 THEN BREAK`.
- `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` spoken with no loop around them are rejected when the scroll is read: *"BREAK can only be used inside a loop."*
- A rite is a boundary: a `BREAK` inside a rite answers only to loops within that rite, never to the loop that called the rite.

## 9. Rites

**DEFINE RITE** names a reusable blessing with parameters; **RETURN** sends a value back; **INVOKE** calls it as a statement, or call it bare inside any expression:

```godcode
DEFINE RITE BLESSING(name)
  RETURN "grace upon " + name
END RITE

INVOKE BLESSING("seeker")              # statement form
DECLARE word AS BLESSING("seeker")     # expression form
REVEAL(word)                           # grace upon seeker
```

- Parameters bind in a child scope of the rite's **definition site**. Rites are closures.
- Calling with the wrong number of arguments is an error.
- `RETURN` with no value returns `void`.

## 10. Calling Things

When you call `NAME(args)`, the heavens are searched in this order:

1. **`contract("name")`** — the one special form; forges a new contract.
2. **A rite you defined** (or imported from a scroll).
3. **A built-in rite** (§13).
4. Otherwise: *"no such rite"* — an error naming the unknown name.

## 11. Lists and Indexing

```godcode
DECLARE tribes AS [Judah, Reuben, Gad, Asher]
REVEAL(tribes[0])     # Judah
REVEAL(tribes[-1])    # Asher — negative indices count from the end
REVEAL("peace"[0])    # p — strings index too
```

Indexing past the ends is an error. Build lists with `[...]` literals, comma `DECLARE`, or `PUSH`.

## 12. IMPORT

`IMPORT` runs another God Code file's top-level statements in your current scope:

```godcode
IMPORT "math"          # the built-in scroll of numbers
IMPORT "strings"       # the built-in scroll of strings
IMPORT "./helpers"     # your own scroll, beside this file
```

Resolution order: (1) beside the importing file (`helpers` → `helpers.god`), (2) the current working directory, (3) the **built-in scroll library** (`godcode/scrolls/`), (4) scrolls installed from the registry (§22: `~/.godcode/scrolls/` or the project's `.godcode/`). Importing in a circle is refused.

## 13. Built-in Rites

Always present, no import needed:

| Rite | Signature | Speaks |
|---|---|---|
| `LEN` | `LEN(x)` | length of a list or string |
| `STR` | `STR(x)` | the value as a string |

| `RANDOM` | `RANDOM(n)` | an integer from `0` to `n-1` |
| `RANGE` | `RANGE(n)` / `RANGE(a, b)` | list like Python's `range` (`RANGE(1,4)` → `[1, 2, 3]`) |
| `PUSH` | `PUSH(list, x)` | a **new** list with `x` appended |

| `ASK` | `ASK(prompt)` | asks the human; the prompt may be omitted |
| `BEHOLD` | `BEHOLD()` | the current moment, as an ISO datetime string |
| `REVERSE` | `REVERSE(x)` | a string or list, backwards |

| `CONSULT` | `CONSULT("question")` | two to three sentences of counsel from the local Spirit oracle (see §27) |

### Standard-library rites

The standard library registers thirty-eight more rites at startup, in four
parts: the vault (`godcode/stdlib_vault.py`: JSON and the filesystem),
time plus the web (`godcode/stdlib_times.py`), the scrollhouse of
hashes (`godcode/stdlib_hashes.py`), and the commons
(`godcode/stdlib_commons.py`: everyday tools for words, lists, maps, and
numbers). They are always present, no import needed.

| Rite | Signature | Speaks |
|---|---|---|
| `DATE_TODAY` | `DATE_TODAY()` | today's local date: `"2026-09-24"` |
| `TIME_NOW` | `TIME_NOW()` | the current local time, in ISO 8601 |
| `FORMAT_DATE` | `FORMAT_DATE(date, pattern)` | a `"YYYY-MM-DD"` word shaped by a strftime pattern |
| `HTTP_GET` | `HTTP_GET(url)` | the body of an HTTP GET, as a word |
| `JSON_PARSE` | `JSON_PARSE(text)` | a JSON word parsed into numbers, words, lists, and maps (`null` → `void`) |
| `JSON_STRING` | `JSON_STRING(value)` | a value rendered as compact JSON |
| `READ_FILE` | `READ_FILE(path)` | a file's text, as a word |
| `WRITE_FILE` | `WRITE_FILE(path, text)` | writes text to the file; returns the character count |
| `FILE_EXISTS` | `FILE_EXISTS(path)` | `TRUE` when the path exists, `FALSE` otherwise |
| `LIST_DIR` | `LIST_DIR(path)` | the directory's entry names, sorted |
| `SHA256` | `SHA256(x)` | the SHA-256 fingerprint of a word, number, or truth, as 64 hex characters |
| `HMAC` | `HMAC(key, message)` | the HMAC-SHA-256 seal of a message under a key, as 64 hex characters |
| `BASE64_ENCODE` | `BASE64_ENCODE(x)` | a word veiled in base64 |
| `BASE64_DECODE` | `BASE64_DECODE(s)` | the unveiled word behind a base64 veil (a gentle error if the veil is ill-formed) |
| `TRIM` | `TRIM(s)` | the word with leading and trailing whitespace lifted away |
| `REPLACE` | `REPLACE(s, old, new)` | the word with every `old` turned into `new` |
| `STARTS_WITH` / `ENDS_WITH` | `STARTS_WITH(s, p)` | `TRUE` when the word opens (or closes) with the given part |
| `SUBSTRING` | `SUBSTRING(s, start [, end])` | the slice from `start` (counting from 0); edges beyond the word are gathered in |
| `CONTAINS` | `CONTAINS(s, part)` / `CONTAINS(list, x)` | `TRUE` when the word holds the part, or the list holds the value |
| `COUNT` | `COUNT(s, part)` | how many times the part appears in the word |
| `SORT` | `SORT(list)` | a **new** list, ordered (numbers, words, or truths; mixed kinds are refused) |
| `MIN_OF` / `MAX_OF` | `MIN_OF(list)` | the least (or greatest) member; an empty gathering is refused |
| `SUM_OF` | `SUM_OF(list)` | the numbers added together (`0` for an empty list) |
| `FIRST` / `LAST` | `FIRST(list)` | the head (or tail) member; an empty gathering is refused |
| `UNIQUE` | `UNIQUE(list)` | the list with repeats removed, order kept |
| `INDEX_OF` | `INDEX_OF(list, x)` | the position of `x` counting from 0, or `-1` when absent |
| `KEYS` / `VALUES` | `KEYS(map)` | the map's keys (or values), as a list |
| `HAS_KEY` | `HAS_KEY(map, key)` | `TRUE` when the map holds the key |
| `MERGE` | `MERGE(m1, m2)` | a **new** map holding both; the second map's keys win |
| `ABS` | `ABS(n)` | the number's distance from zero |
| `ROUND` | `ROUND(n [, places])` | rounded half away from zero (`ROUND(2.5)` → `3`) |
| `FLOOR` / `CEIL` | `FLOOR(n)` | the whole number below (or above) |
| `SQRT` | `SQRT(n)` | the square root (a gentle error for negatives) |
| `POW` | `POW(base, exp)` | the base raised to the exponent |

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  REVEAL(DATE_TODAY())                       # "2026-09-24"
  REVEAL(FORMAT_DATE("2026-09-24", "%A"))    # "Thursday"
  DECLARE tribes AS JSON_PARSE("[\"Judah\", \"Reuben\"]")
  REVEAL(tribes[0])                          # "Judah"
  REVEAL(JSON_STRING([1, 2]))                 # "[1,2]"
  DECLARE count AS WRITE_FILE("note.txt", "peace")
  IF FILE_EXISTS("note.txt") THEN
    REVEAL(LIST_DIR("."))                    # sorted entry names
  ENDIF
  DECLARE psalm AS READ_FILE("psalm.txt")
END CREATION
```

The names `DATE_TODAY` and `TIME_NOW` are chosen on purpose: the `time`
scroll (§14) already defines rites named `NOW` and `TODAY`, and a builtin
by either name would shadow them.

`HTTP_GET` follows redirects and waits up to ten seconds. It is **blocked
under `godcode run --sandbox`**: the sandbox withholds network power, so
the rite raises instead of reaching out. The file rites are likewise
bound by the sandbox's read and write grants (see §23 and
`docs/sandbox.md`). The hash rites and the commons rites are pure
computation (they touch no files and no network), so they need no grant
and behave the same inside the sandbox.

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  REVEAL(SHA256("manna"))                    # a 64-character fingerprint
  DECLARE sig AS HMAC("secret", "the covenant stands")
  REVEAL(sig IS HMAC("secret", "the covenant stands"))   # true: the seal holds
  REVEAL(sig IS HMAC("other", "the covenant stands"))    # false: the seal breaks
  REVEAL(BASE64_DECODE(BASE64_ENCODE("veiled")))          # "veiled"
END CREATION
```

The commons rites turn everyday work into one line:

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  REVEAL(TRIM("  grace upon grace  "))          # "grace upon grace"
  REVEAL(REPLACE("manna, manna", "manna", "bread"))
  REVEAL(SORT([3, 1, 2]))                       # [1, 2, 3]
  REVEAL(SUM_OF([1, 2, 3, 4]))                   # 10
  REVEAL(UNIQUE(["a", "b", "a"]))               # ["a", "b"]
  REVEAL(INDEX_OF(["a", "b", "c"], "c"))        # 2
  DECLARE census AS JSON_PARSE("{{\"tribes\": 12}}")
  REVEAL(HAS_KEY(census, "tribes"))             # true
  REVEAL(MERGE(census, JSON_PARSE("{{\"judges\": 3}}")))
  REVEAL(ROUND(2.5))                            # 3
  REVEAL(SQRT(144))                             # 12
  REVEAL(POW(2, 10))                            # 1024
END CREATION
```

## 14. The Scrolls (Standard Library)

Six scrolls ship inside the package at `godcode/scrolls/`, written **in God Code itself**. Import by bare name:

### 📐 `math` — `IMPORT "math"`
`SQRT(x)` (Newton's method, via `WHILE`), `POW(b, e)`, `ABS(x)`, `MIN(a, b)`, `MAX(a, b)`, `FACTORIAL(n)`, `IS_EVEN(n)`.

### 🔤 `strings` — `IMPORT "strings"`
`SHOUT(s)` → `UPPER(s) + "!"`, `WHISPER(s)` → `LOWER(s)`, `WORDS(s)` → `SPLIT(s, " ")`, `CHARS(s)` → `SPLIT(s, "")`, `FIRST(s)`, `LAST(s)`.

### 📋 `lists` — `IMPORT "lists"`
`SUM(xs)`, `AVG(xs)`, `CONTAINS(xs, x)`, `SECOND(xs)`, `TAIL(xs)`, `COUNT(xs, x)`.

### ⏳ `time` — `IMPORT "time"`
`NOW()` → `BEHOLD()` (full ISO timestamp), `TODAY()` → the date part before the `T`.

### 🔮 `prophecy` — `IMPORT "prophecy"`
`PROPHESY_NUMBER(n)` → `RANDOM(n)`, `CAST_LOTS()` → `RANDOM(2)`, `CHOOSE(xs)` → a random element.

### 🤝 `covenant` — `IMPORT "covenant"`
`NEW_COVENANT(name)` → `contract(name)`, `SEAL_COVENANT(c)` → seals it in one breath.

## 15. The Covenant Ledger

Every `SEAL` appends a **block** to `covenant.chain` (JSONL): `{index, timestamp, record, prev_hash, hash}`, where `hash = sha256(...)` chains to the previous block and the chain begins at `"GENESIS"`. For contracts, the record carries name, life, blessing, and anointing.

```bash
godcode ledger verify                        # N covenants intact 🔒 · M anchors intact ⚓
godcode ledger verify --file my.chain        # custom covenant chain
godcode ledger verify --anchor-file my.chain # custom anchor chain
```

A broken chain reports exactly where: `chain broken at block K`.

The anchor chain is the companion ledger: every `ANCHOR` writes the
anchored value's hash as a block (see §26), so `ledger verify` attests
both what was sealed *and* what was anchored.

## 16. The Spirit Engine

The Spirit reads `god_code_training_dataset.csv` (code → intent → spiritual intent → suggestion) and offers two ministries:

- **`classify(text)`** → `{intent, confidence, spiritual_intent, suggestion, keywords}` — keyword-overlap intent detection. When the Spirit is silent: intent `"Silent contemplation"`, confidence `0.0`, suggestion `"BREATHE and try again."`
- **`prophesy(program_text)`** — classifies each line, finds the dominant intent, and composes a 2–3 sentence divine forecast naming that intent, the average confidence, and the top suggestion.

`PROPHESY` in a program calls this engine; if no engine is bound, a gentle fallback answers.

**The intent ministry.** The Spirit now also keeps the declared
intents of rites and discerns drift:

- **`declare_intent(rite_name, text)`** — register a natural-language intent on a rite.
- **`intents_aligned(declared_text, discerned)`** — `True` when the declared words and the discerned intent share keywords; the blessing check behind every rite invocation.
- **`resolve_intent(text)`** — like `classify`, plus `aligned_with`: every declared intent the words align with, each naming the rite, the declaration, and the shared keywords.
- **`counsel(question)`** — two to three sentences of counsel naming the discerned intent, its confidence, and the next suggestion; the voice behind `CONSULT` (§27).

## 17. The Audit Log

Every run appends to `logs/godcode.log` (override with `godcode run --log PATH`):

```
SESSION BEGIN my_creation.god 2026-09-21T12:00:00
[2026-09-21T12:00:01] 3 :: Declare :: seeker = worthy
[2026-09-21T12:00:01] 7 :: Seal :: covenant -> block 3
SESSION END
```

Each executed statement is timestamped with its line — the divine audit trail the founders asked for, fulfilled.

## 18. The Command Line

After `pip install -e .`, the `godcode` command is yours:

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `godcode run <file> [--log PATH]` | run a creation; errors print to stderr, exit 1 |
| `godcode run --sandbox [--sandbox-timeout SECS] <file>` | run inside the guarded sandbox (deny-by-default; see §23) |
| `godcode scroll list\|info\|install\|publish` | browse, inspect, install, and publish registry scrolls (see §22) |
| `godcode lsp` | start the language server over stdio (see §24) |
| `godcode check <file>` | lex + parse only → `✓ <file> is pure.` |
| `godcode check --json <file>` / `godcode run --json <file>` | machine-readable JSON reports for AI agents: diagnostics with line/col/code/hint, output lines, seals, timing (see `docs/agentics.md`) |
| `godcode repl` | **Live Mode** 🕊 — type code, end a block with a blank line; `:quit`/`:q` or Ctrl-D to ascend |
| `godcode test [dir] [--json]` | run the `TEST_` rites in a directory's test scrolls (§29) |
| `godcode fmt <file> [--in-place\|-w]` | re-emit canonical source: 2-space indent, one statement per line, keywords UPPER |
| `godcode ledger verify [--file PATH] [--anchor-file PATH]` | verify the covenant chain **and** the anchor chain (§26) |
| `godcode intent "words..." [--json]` | resolve the intent behind words with the Spirit (§25) |
| `godcode tools [--json]` | show the six MCP-compatible agent tool schemas (§28) |
| `godcode bridge` | serve the agent tool bridge (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, §28) |

With no arguments, `python main.py` runs `sample.godcode` — the original v1 creation, still honored.

## 19. Error Philosophy

God Code errors are **divine-flavored but genuinely helpful**: they always name the line, say what was expected or what went wrong, and never mock the creator.

```text
The heavens reject this offering (line 7): division by nothing is not permitted.
```

Common rejections you may meet:

| You wrote | The heavens answer |
|---|---|
| `1 / 0` | *…division by nothing is not permitted / cannot divide by nothing* |
| `BREATHE LIFE INTO ghost` | *there is no `ghost` to breathe into* |
| `INVOKE MISSING()` | *There is no rite named 'MISSING' — the heavens do not know it* (plus `Did you mean …?` when a close name exists) |
| `xs[99]` | *index out of range* |
| `TESTIFY(0)` | *testimony failed* |
| endless `WHILE` | *The cycle is endless* (after 100,000 turns) |
| `1 + "a"` on wrong types | *cannot join … and …* |

Parse errors name the expected versus the found, with line and column.

### The Spirit corrects gently

A misspelled name is answered with a suggestion, never scorn:

```text
There is no rite named 'BLESSIN' — the heavens do not know it. Did you mean 'BLESSING'? (line 5)
  5 |   INVOKE BLESSIN("seeker")
```

`godcode run`, `godcode run --sandbox`, `godcode check`, and `godcode fmt` print the offending line beneath the message, with a caret marking the column when one is known. The same suggestion also rides along in the `message` field of `check --json` and `run --json` diagnostics, so agents see it too.

### Call traces for uncaught errors

When a runtime error escapes every `TRY` and rises through rite calls, the human CLI prints the call stack beneath the gentle error, oldest call first:

```text
Division by nothing is not permitted. Even the heavens cannot split the void. (line 3)
  3 |   DECLARE x AS 1 / 0
Called by outer at line 11
Called by middle at line 9
Called by innermost at line 6
(most recent call last)
```

Each line names the rite and the line where it was called. An error raised at the top level, with no rite calls above it, shows no trace section. In `run --json`, the same stack rides in the error object as a `trace` array of `{rite, line}` objects, oldest call first:

```json
"error": {
  "line": 3,
  "code": "RUNTIME_ERROR",
  "message": "Division by nothing is not permitted. Even the heavens cannot split the void.",
  "trace": [
    {"rite": "outer", "line": 11},
    {"rite": "middle", "line": 9},
    {"rite": "innermost", "line": 6}
  ]
}
```

Every other field of the error object is unchanged.

## 20. Two Annotated Programs

### The Seven Seals (decisions + cycles)

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  # RANGE(1, 36) walks 1..35 — the seals are counted.
  FOR n IN RANGE(1, 36)
    # The 35th seal is the seal of seals.
    IF n % 35 IS 0 THEN
      REVEAL("seal of seals")
    ELSE
      # Every other multiple of 7 is a seal; the rest are numbers.
      IF n % 7 IS 0 THEN
        REVEAL("seal")
      ELSE
        REVEAL(n)
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  ASCEND
END CREATION
```

Run it: `godcode run examples/seven_seals.god`. `seal` appears at 7, 14, 21, 28, and `seal of seals` at 35.

### The Covenant Keeper (contracts + rites + sealing)

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  # A rite that seals any covenant brought before it.
  DEFINE RITE SEAL_COVENANT(c)
    SEAL c
  END RITE

  # Forge the contract, breathe life, bless, anoint.
  DECLARE pact AS contract("everlasting")
  BREATHE LIFE INTO pact
  BLESS pact
  ANOINT pact
  REVEAL(pact)

  # Contracts are known by their names.
  IF pact IS contract("everlasting") THEN
    REVEAL("the covenant stands")
  ENDIF

  # Write it into the chain, then ascend.
  INVOKE SEAL_COVENANT(pact)
  ASCEND
END CREATION
```

## 21. SUMMON — Calling Upon Plugins

`SUMMON("plugin.verb", args…)` is the bridge from God Code into Python: it invokes a **plugin verb** through the foreign-function interface. Plugins are small Python modules living in `plugins/` (or a configured plugin path) that expose a `register(interpreter)` function; each verb they register becomes callable by name.

```godcode
DECLARE the_hour AS SUMMON("clockwork.now")     # the example clockwork plugin
REVEAL("the clockwork speaks: " + STR(the_hour))
```

- The first argument is always the verb address: `"plugin.verb"`. Remaining arguments are passed through as God Code values.
- Calling an unregistered verb is a divine error naming the missing plugin and verb.
- See `examples/summon_demo.god` and the full story in [`docs/plugins.md`](plugins.md), which also documents the embedding API (`godcode.run_source()` / `godcode.run_file()` for calling God Code *from* Python).

## 22. The Scroll Registry

Beyond the six built-in scrolls (§14), the community publishes **registry scrolls** — versioned packages described by a `scroll.toml` manifest:

```bash
godcode scroll list                 # browse the local registry
godcode scroll info blessings       # inspect a scroll before receiving it
godcode scroll install blessings    # install into ~/.godcode/scrolls/ (or the project's .godcode/)
godcode scroll publish ./my_scroll  # share your own scroll from a directory
```

Installed scrolls are reached with ordinary `IMPORT`. The import resolver checks installed scrolls after the built-in library (§12). See `examples/scroll_blessings_demo.god` and [`docs/scroll-registry.md`](scroll-registry.md).

## 23. The Sandbox

`godcode run --sandbox` executes a creation inside a guarded chamber. The `SandboxPolicy` is **deny-by-default**: filesystem reads/writes, network access, subprocesses, and untrusted import paths are refused, and each run is bounded by a **timeout** (seconds) and a **step budget** so runaway creations are stopped, not suffered.

```bash
godcode run --sandbox examples/sandbox_safe.god
godcode run --sandbox --sandbox-timeout 5 examples/sandbox_safe.god
```

Pure creations — numbers, cycles, revelation — pass through in peace; anything reaching for the world outside is refused with a clear, line-numbered message. Full policy detail lives in [`docs/sandbox.md`](sandbox.md).

## 24. The Language Server

`godcode lsp` starts a language server speaking JSON-RPC over stdio — the same protocol VS Code, Neovim, Emacs, and friends use. It answers `initialize`, `textDocument/didOpen`, `textDocument/didChange`, `textDocument/hover`, and `textDocument/completion`, and pushes `publishDiagnostics` as you type, so errors are underlined before a file is ever run.

```bash
godcode lsp     # point your editor's LSP client at this command
```

Editor setup notes live in [`docs/lsp.md`](lsp.md) and `editors/`.

## 25. Declared Intent

A rite can carry a named purpose, spoken in plain human words:

```godcode
DECLARE INTENT "bring peace to the household" ON evening_blessing
```

When the rite is invoked, the Spirit discerns the rite's actual intent by
classifying its words, and compares it with the declaration:

- **Aligned** — an `[INTENT]` notice blesses the invocation.
- **Drifted** — a gentle `[WARNING]` names the declared intent, the
  discerned intent, and counsels without condemning. The run continues;
  drift can never fail a creation.

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  DECLARE INTENT "bring peace to the household" ON evening_blessing

  DEFINE RITE evening_blessing()
    REVEAL("peace upon this house")
  END RITE

  INVOKE evening_blessing()
END CREATION
```

```
[INTENT] evening_blessing now carries the intent: "bring peace to the household" 🕊
[INTENT] evening_blessing walks in its declared intent: "bring peace to the household" 🕊
peace upon this house
```

Every invocation is recorded in `intent_checks` (`{rite, declared,
discerned, confidence, aligned}`), and `godcode run --json` carries them
in an `intents` array so agents can audit alignment after the fact.
`godcode intent "words..."` resolves any words through the same engine.
See `examples/intent_demo.god`.

## 26. Blockchain-Anchored Seals

`ANCHOR(x)` writes the SHA-256 hash of a value to a tamper-evident chain
and returns a **receipt map**:

```godcode
DECLARE receipt AS ANCHOR(covenant)
REVEAL(receipt["anchor_hash"])   # the chain's fingerprint of this anchor
REVEAL(receipt["height"])        # 0, 1, 2, … — this anchor's block height
REVEAL(receipt["chain"])        # which chain witnessed it
```

The receipt holds `{chain, anchor_hash, height, timestamp,
payload_hash}`; it reveals as `{chain: simulated, anchor_hash: …}` and
`TYPE(receipt)` is `"map"`. A second argument names the chain:
`ANCHOR(x, simulated)`. An unknown chain is a clean runtime error naming
the registered adapters.

The default adapter is **`simulated`**: a local, genesis-anchored JSONL
chain (`anchors.chain`) with the same block shape as the covenant ledger.
No wallets, no keys, no network calls. It is a stand-in with the exact
shape of a real chain, so a real adapter can be registered later through
the `ChainAdapter` interface (`anchor(payload_hash) -> receipt`,
`verify(receipt) -> bool`) without the language changing. An ephemeral
in-memory adapter serves guarded runs. `godcode ledger verify` attests
both chains. See `examples/anchor_demo.god`.

## 27. The Oracle — CONSULT

```godcode
REVEAL(CONSULT("How should I structure this covenant?"))
```

`CONSULT` lays a question before the local Spirit oracle and receives two
to three sentences of counsel: the discerned intent, its confidence, and
the next suggestion. It is entirely local — no external calls, no API
keys — and it works inside the sandbox. When no Spirit is bound, it
answers gently that the Spirit is silent rather than failing. The question
must be a string. See `examples/consult_demo.god`.

## 28. The Agent Tool Bridge

God Code speaks the language agents speak. `godcode tools [--json]` prints six
**MCP-compatible tool schemas** — `check`, `run`, `consult`, `intent`,
`anchor_verify`, `ledger_verify`, ready to paste into any agent
framework that speaks the Model Context Protocol:

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `check` | validate a scroll; returns `{ok, diagnostics}` |
| `run` | execute a scroll in the sandbox; returns `{ok, output, seals, intents, error}` |
| `consult` | ask the Spirit oracle a question; returns `{ok, counsel}` |
| `intent` | resolve the intent behind words; returns `{ok, result}` |
| `anchor_verify` | verify an anchor receipt against the chain; returns `{ok, valid, message}` |
| `ledger_verify` | verify both the covenant chain and the anchor chain |

`godcode bridge` serves the same tools as a **JSON-RPC 2.0 server over
stdio** (`initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`), so an agent
host can call God Code like any other tool. The canonical agent workflow
remains: generate → `check --json` → fix from diagnostics →
`run --sandbox --json` → inspect `output`/`error`/`intents` → iterate.
Now, as all good works do, the workflow begins with a declared intent.

## 29. Testing — `godcode test`

A **test scroll** is any `.god` file named `test_*.god` or `*_test.god`.
Inside it, every rite named `TEST_*` is one test case (names are
case-insensitive, like all keywords). `TESTIFY` is the assertion: a
testimony that holds passes; one that fails — or any runtime error —
fails that test.

```godcode
BEGIN CREATION
  IMPORT "lists"

  DEFINE RITE TEST_sum_of_tribes()
    DECLARE tribes AS [Judah, Reuben, Gad]
    TESTIFY LEN(tribes) IS 3
  END RITE

  DEFINE RITE TEST_avg_is_fair()
    TESTIFY AVG([2, 4]) IS 3
  END RITE
END CREATION
```

```bash
godcode test                # test the scrolls in the current directory
godcode test tests/         # test the scrolls in tests/
godcode test --json         # machine-readable report
```

The report prints one line per test, then a summary — in the plain voice
of the language, no decoration:

```text
PASS  test_lists.god :: TEST_sum_of_tribes
FAIL  test_lists.god :: TEST_avg_is_fair :: The testimony has failed. What was spoken does not hold true. (line 11)
1 passed, 1 failed.
```

The rules the runner keeps:

- **Isolation.** Each `TEST_*` rite runs in a fresh interpreter. The
  scroll's top-level words run again before every test, so one test can
  never see another's state — not even across files.
- **One scroll, one parse.** A scroll that cannot be read or parsed is
  reported as a file-level failure (`(scroll)`) and never crashes the run.
- **Parameters are not called.** A `TEST_` rite that asks for offerings is
  reported as `SKIP`, with the reason, and does not fail the run.
- **Names are namespaced by file.** Two scrolls may each define
  `TEST_same`; both run, both are reported.
- **Discovery is shallow.** Only the given directory's own scrolls are
  read; subfolders are not entered. Files named anything else are left
  untouched, even if they define `TEST_` rites.
- **Quiet runs.** `REVEAL` lines and `[TESTIFY]` notices are swallowed so
  the report stays one line per test.

Exit codes: `0` when every test passes (skips do not fail the run),
`1` when any test fails, `2` on usage error (for example, a directory
that does not exist). Tests run the way `godcode run` does — no Spirit,
no ledger, no sandbox — so only test scrolls you wrote or trust.

`--json` emits one document for agents and tooling:

```json
{"tool": "godcode", "command": "test", "dir": ".",
 "tests": [{"file": "test_lists.god", "rite": "TEST_sum_of_tribes",
            "ok": true, "message": ""}],
 "passed": 1, "failed": 0, "skipped": 0}
```

`ok` is `true` (passed), `false` (failed), or `null` (skipped).
File-level failures appear as entries with `"rite": "(scroll)"`.
Scrolls that hold no `TEST_` rites are noted in the text report only
(`test_empty.god :: no TEST_ rites found.`) and do not fail the run.
