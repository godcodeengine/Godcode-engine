# AGENTS.md — God Code, for AI agents

God Code is a small divine-flavored programming language ("scrolls", `.god`
files). This file tells an AI agent how to generate, validate, and run it
safely. Prefer these commands over scraping prose output.

## Validate first, always

```bash
godcode check --json scroll.god
```

Returns one JSON document: `{"tool":"godcode","command":"check","file":…,
"ok":true|false,"diagnostics":[{line,col,code,severity,message,hint}]}`.
Exit 0 = pure, 1 = diagnostics, 2 = usage error. Fix every diagnostic
before running. `line`/`col` are 1-based; `col` may be null.

## Execute safely

```bash
godcode run --sandbox --json scroll.god
```

Same exit-code convention. JSON shape: `{"tool","command","file","ok",
"output":[…],"seals":[{block,hash}],"error":{…}|null,"stats":{"ms":…}}`.
`output` = every line printed during the run (REVEAL lines plus engine
notices like `[SEAL]`); on runtime error it holds lines revealed *before*
the error, and `error` carries `line`/`col`/`code`/`message`. `--sandbox`
confines execution; `--json` composes with plain `run`/`check` too.

## Share scrolls

```bash
godcode new my-scroll      # raise a project: main.god, test_main.god,
                           # scroll.toml, README.md (--json for agents)
godcode scroll …          # install / publish / verify scrolls in the registry
godcode ledger verify     # verify the covenant chain
```

## Language gotchas (check these before "fixing" generated code)

- Every program needs `BEGIN CREATION` … `END CREATION`. Nothing runs outside it.
- Comments start with `#` and run to end of line.
- Comparisons use `IS` / `IS NOT` (`==`/`!=` also work). Assignment is `DECLARE x AS …`.
- Keywords are case-insensitive; canonical style is UPPER.
- Output: `REVEAL(expr)`. Input-free; there is no stdin.
- Strings breathe values in: `"grace upon {name}"` interpolates any expression (`{a * b}`, `{UPPER(name)}`); `{{` and `}}` write a plain brace.
- Blocks close explicitly: `ENDIF`, `ENDFOR`, `ENDWHILE`, `END RITE`.
- `SEAL(expr)` appends a tamper-evident covenant block to the ledger.
- `ANCHOR(expr [, chain])` anchors a value's hash on a chain (default
  `simulated`, a local genesis-anchored chain) and returns a receipt map
  `{chain, anchor_hash, height, timestamp, payload_hash}` — index it like
  `receipt["anchor_hash"]`; `TYPE(receipt)` is `"map"`.
- `SHA256(x)` fingerprints a word, number, or truth as 64 hex characters.
  `HMAC(key, message)` seals a message under a key (HMAC-SHA-256).
  `BASE64_ENCODE(x)` / `BASE64_DECODE(s)` veil and unveil words. All four
  are pure: they need no import and run unchanged under `--sandbox`.
- The commons: everyday tools, always present, pure and sandbox-safe.
  Words: `TRIM`, `REPLACE`, `STARTS_WITH`, `ENDS_WITH`, `SUBSTRING`,
  `CONTAINS`, `COUNT`, `REPEAT`. Lists: `SORT` (returns a new list), `MIN_OF`,
  `MAX_OF`, `SUM_OF`, `FIRST`, `LAST`, `UNIQUE`, `INDEX_OF` (-1 when
  absent). Maps: `KEYS`, `VALUES`, `HAS_KEY`, `MERGE` (returns a new
  map). Numbers: `ABS`, `ROUND` (half away from zero), `FLOOR`, `CEIL`,
  `SQRT`, `POW`. To write a literal `{` inside a string, double it:
  `"{{"` (a lone `{` opens interpolation).
- `CONSULT("question")` asks the local Spirit oracle; answers in 2-3
  sentences, works in the sandbox, never fails the run.
- `DECLARE INTENT "words..." ON rite_name` names a rite's purpose; at
  invocation the Spirit checks alignment and counsels gently on drift.
  Drift can never fail a run.
- `ASCEND` ends the run peacefully (not an error).
- An unbound name evaluates to a Symbol. It does not raise. `BREATHE LIFE INTO`
  an undeclared name *does* raise at runtime.
- Error messages may end with `Did you mean 'X'?` (misspelled rite, variable,
  bless target, or map key). The human CLI (`run`, `run --sandbox`, `check`,
  `fmt`) prints the offending source line beneath the message, with a caret at
  the column when known.
- Tongues: a scroll with `# tongue: tn` writes keywords in Setswana
  (`SIMOLOLA`/`BEGIN`, `SENOLA`/`REVEAL`, `FA`/`IF`...), and a scroll with
  `# tongue: zu` writes them in isiZulu (`QALA`/`BEGIN`, `VEZA`/`REVEAL`,
  `UMA`/`IF`...); see `docs/TONGUES.md` for both word tables.
  English keywords still work in the same file. `fmt` renders canonical
  English; the named tools (`SHA256`, `UPPER`, ...) never translate. The
  language server reads the pragma: completions offer `SENOLA (REVEAL)`
  for Setswana or `VEZA (REVEAL)` for isiZulu, plus block snippets in the
  tongue, and hover shows the English keyword's docs for a tongue word.
  The VS Code grammar highlights Setswana and isiZulu keywords too.
- Division by zero is rejected: "division by nothing is not permitted".

## Error codes (`--json`)

| Code | Meaning | Typical fix |
|---|---|---|
| `LEXER_ERROR` | bad characters / unterminated string | check quotes on the reported line |
| `PARSE_ERROR` | grammar violation | missing BEGIN/END CREATION or block closer |
| `RUNTIME_ERROR` | failed while running | DECLARE names before use; re-read the line |
| `FILE_ERROR` | scroll unreadable | check the path |

## Agent workflow

generate → `check --json` → fix from diagnostics → `run --sandbox --json`
→ inspect `output`/`error`/`intents` → iterate. Never run untrusted scrolls without
`--sandbox`. Keep the human's production checklist (provider contracts,
real credentials, Bank of Botswana sandbox submission) out of the way.
Demo in sandbox mode.

## Agent tool bridge

Six MCP-compatible tool schemas for agent frameworks, plus a JSON-RPC
bridge over stdio:

```bash
godcode tools --json     # check, run, consult, intent, anchor_verify, ledger_verify
godcode bridge           # serve the tools to an agent host over stdio
godcode intent "words"   # resolve the intent behind words with the Spirit
godcode ledger verify    # attest the covenant chain AND the anchor chain
```

`run --json` reports now carry an `intents` array: one entry per invoked
rite carrying a `DECLARE INTENT`, with `declared`, `discerned`,
`confidence`, and `aligned`. Declare the intent of generated rites and
check `intents` for drift after each run.

## House rules for agents working on God Code

- **No version numbers in anything a human reads.** God Code releases by date now, not by numbers. Never write a version label in a commit
  message, a doc, a site page, a README, a changelog header, or a Discord
  announcement. Changelog entries are headed by date. The future is commits,
  not versions.
- Structural versions stay but stay invisible: `pyproject.toml`,
  `godcode/__init__.py` `__version__`, scroll manifest `version` fields,
  registry dependency versions, `/v1/` API paths, and the VS Code
  `package.json` version are machine-readable packaging facts. Never mention
  them in prose, headings, or announcements.
- Never use em dashes (—) or spaced en dashes between sentences in
  user-facing text. Use a full stop instead.
