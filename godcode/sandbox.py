"""In-process sandbox for God Code v3.0 — Pillar 1 ("Strong Foundations").

Runs a God Code creation under a deny-by-default :class:`SandboxPolicy`:
every side-effecting power (scroll imports outside the consecrated paths,
the ASK rite that speaks with the outer world) is withheld unless the
policy explicitly grants it. File-writing rites keep their meaning but
not their reach: ANCHOR is answered with an ephemeral in-memory chain,
so nothing is ever written to disk. A step budget and a wall-clock grant
bound runaway creations.

Entry points
------------
``run_sandboxed(source, policy, source_name)``
    Lex, parse, and run ``source`` under ``policy``; returns the list of
    REVEAL lines captured during the run.

``apply_policy(interpreter, policy)``
    Install the sandbox hooks on an existing ``Interpreter``; returns the
    ``Sandbox`` guard.

``SandboxPolicy.strict(...)``
    The policy the CLI uses: no writes, no network, no subprocesses, no
    stdin, scroll imports limited to the stdlib scrolls and (optionally)
    the creation's own directory, a 5-second time grant, and a 100,000
    step budget.

Honest limits (see docs/sandbox.md): this is an *in-process* sandbox —
a cooperative audit of the tree-walker, not OS-level isolation. It
cannot contain a hostile program that escapes the interpreter, and it
cannot cap memory.

    ``allow_read_paths``
        Approved directories for filesystem *reads*. ``None`` (the
        default) denies all reads; a tuple of directories grants reads
        under those trees. (No file-reading rites exist in v2.0; this is
        enforced should any be added.)
    ``allow_write`` / ``allow_network`` / ``allow_subprocess``
        Filesystem writes, network access, subprocess spawning. All deny
        by default. The ANCHOR rite is the one file-writing rite: under a
        policy that denies writes it is answered with an ephemeral
        in-memory chain instead of being refused, so creations keep
        their meaning without touching the disk.
    ``allow_stdin``
        Whether the ASK rite may speak with the outer world (``input()``).
        Denied by default.
    ``allowed_import_paths``
        Approved directories for IMPORT of scrolls. Empty (the default)
        denies every import. Each entry is a directory; a scroll is
        allowed if its real path lies under one of them.
    ``timeout_seconds``
        Wall-clock grant for the whole run. ``None`` or ``<= 0``
        disables the grant (not recommended).
    ``max_steps``
        Step budget: every statement dispatch and every expression
        evaluation counts one step, bounding both runaway loops and
        unbounded rite recursion.
