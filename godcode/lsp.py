"""Language server for God Code (v3.0, Pillar 4).

A minimal Language Server Protocol implementation over stdio, hand-rolled
on top of the stdlib — no third-party dependencies. JSON-RPC 2.0 messages
are framed with ``Content-Length`` headers, per the LSP base protocol.

Lifecycle::

    godcode lsp                      # start serving on stdin/stdout

Diagnostics are produced by the real lexer/parser pipeline (the same
logic ``godcode check`` uses): opening or changing a ``.god`` scroll
re-parses it and publishes the divine errors as LSP diagnostics.

Protocol notes:
  * All logging goes to stderr. stdout is the protocol channel — nothing
    else may ever be written there.
  * Unknown methods answer with JSON-RPC error -32601 ("Method not found").
  * Malformed frames are skipped; the server keeps serving.
